### Python version 3 required

`git-hub` has been ported to **Python 3**.

As development of Python ended January 1st 2020, the decision was made to drop backwards compatibility.

General migration instructions are given below:

    - Check if **Python3** is installed by using `python --version` or check if the `python3` program exists.
    - If that's not the case use your package manager to install it. E.g. `apt install python3` for **Debian** based distributions.
